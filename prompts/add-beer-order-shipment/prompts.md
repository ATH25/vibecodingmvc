Now I would like to add BeerOrderShipment Entity and Controller. Based on how we added other entities. 
But first, use the requirements defined in prompts/add-beer-order-shipment/requirements.md to generate a detailed implementation plan. Save the plan in prompts/add-beer-order-shipment/plan.md.

The plan should break down all major components listed in the requirements (e.g., entity, DTOs, mapper, service, controller, tests, OpenAPI spec) and describe what needs to be implemented in each. Include relevant naming conventions and note any architectural or testing guidelines to follow.

------------------------------------------------------------------

“Use the plan.md file in prompts/add-beer-order-shipment to create a checklist-style implementation task list in tasks.md, using [ ] for pending and [x] for completed.”

------------------------------------------------------------------

I would like to add BeerOrderShipment Entity and Controller. Based on how we added other entities, use the same project structure and patterns.
Follow the project’s layering and conventions (Java 21, Spring Boot, Maven, Spring Data JPA, MapStruct, DTOs, Controller → Service → Repository).

Use the implementation checklist in prompts/add-beer-order-shipment/tasks.md to implement the BeerOrderShipment feature.

Start completing tasks in order, beginning with the Entity and Controller layers. Mark each completed task with [x] in the tasks.md file.

Do not commit code changes. I will review and commit them after the implementation is complete.

Follow existing project conventions (e.g., Lombok, DTO records, Spring annotations, MapStruct, REST controller patterns, etc.), and ensure consistency with previously implemented features like Customer or Beer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue working through the remaining unchecked tasks in prompts/add-beer-order-shipment/tasks.md, starting from the Repository layer. Mark each completed task with [x] as you go.
